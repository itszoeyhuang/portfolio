                        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                        <p>Hello! Originally from Taiwan, currently based in Vancouver, B.C. I‚Äôve always been drawn to creative aesthetics since I was a kid, which sparked my interest to design digitally and led me to pursue becoming a front-end developer.</p>
                        <p>I discovered that designing and creating websites brings me a sense of peace, allowing me to immerse myself in a space that feels truly my own.</p>
                        <p>A indoor plant collector and crazy in love with my 15 year old Maltese. üê∂</p>

                        <h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>
                        <p>Coming from a multicultural background, I‚Äôm fluent in English, Mandarin, and Taiwanese. My passion for creativity and fashion led me to study fashion in Melbourne, Australia, and later pursue a career in retail and merchandising over the past few years.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, I gained valuable insights into consumer behaviour and visual storytelling which deepened my understanding of how aesthetics and functionality intersect.  This inspired me to focus on creating engaging user experience through tech-world.</p>
